Briefly describe your testing procedure in Q4.txt and describe how you used the values of 
the wait counters and items histogram to understand the execution of your program

testing procedure:

Producer wait: 282626
Consumer wait: 250802
items 0 count 47
items 1 count 64
items 2 count 34
items 3 count 34
items 4 count 34
items 5 count 40
items 6 count 41
items 7 count 36
items 8 count 36
items 9 count 226
items 10 count 208

I created two global variables called producer_wait_counts and consumer_wait_counts. When
the producer and consumers have to wait until the condition is met, the waiting count will
be increased. So at the end I am able to count how many times for both consumer and producer 
wait. And both of the waiting times should be approximately equal. As you could see above that 
the producer wait and consumer wait are approximately the same.

In addition, there is a count value for each of the item. So whenever the item is produced or
consumed, the count will be incremented. Since the NUM_ITERATIONS is fixed to be 200, and we 
have two producers and two consumers. So the total counts would be approximately 200*4 = 800. And 
the above output matches the hypothesis.
